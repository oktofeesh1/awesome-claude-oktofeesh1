 * by handing it to the canonical entry with a 301 instead of returning a 404.
 *
 * Consulted by both entry-detail route shapes (`/entry/$category/$slug` and the

 * crawler holds. Entries listed here should also be removed from `content/` so
 * they drop out of the catalog and sitemap; the redirect remains permanently.
